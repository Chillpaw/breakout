# Breakout Game

Welcome to my breakout game project! This is a beginner project that I'm working on to learn Rust and Bevy, a game engine for the Rust programming language.

I've tried my best to not reference the Bevy breakout example however, the ball collision logic was a challenge so I took a look at the example's code prior to my implementation. All part of the learning process.

## Objective

The objective of the breakout game is to break all the bricks on the screen by bouncing a ball off a paddle. The player controls the paddle and must prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen.

## Controls

- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle horizontally.
- Press the spacebar to launch the ball at the start of the game.

## Features

- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty. (TODO)
- Power-ups and power-downs that affect the gameplay. (TODO)
- Score tracking and high score leaderboard. (TODO)
- Sound effects and visual effects to enhance the gaming experience. (TODO)

## Technologies Used

- Rust programming language
- Bevy game engine
- Other libraries and tools as needed
